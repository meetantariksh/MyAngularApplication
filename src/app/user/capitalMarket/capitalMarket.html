    <h4>Financial Education</h4>
    <div style="text-align: justify; width: 75%; margin: 0 auto;">
        <b>Basics:</b><br>

<b>a. Importance of financial education:</b> As much as skills are required to
earn money, it is required in equal measure in spending it wisely. Accordingly, financial education provides you the basic life skill to build a secure financial future. Proper financial knowledge can improve your ability to save for your long term goals and prevent you and your family from financial exigencies. It is important to know the following concepts:<br>
<b>b. SavingsandInvesting:</b>
Saving is the excess of your income over your expenditure. Generally, savings is in the form of savings bank account and cash. Your money is very safe in a savings account, earning a small rate of interest and you can get back your money as and when you need it (high liquidity).
Whereas when you are investing, you are setting your money aside for long term goals. It is normal for investments to rise and fall in value over time. However, in the end, prudent investments can earn a lot more than in your savings account.<br>
<b>c. Budgeting</b>
The first step in your financial planning is budgeting - a process for tracking, planning and controlling the inflow and outflow of your income. It entails identifying all the sources of income and taking into account all current and future expenses, with an aim to meet your financial goals. The primary aim of a budgeting is to ensure reasonable savings after providing for all expenses.<br>
Benefits of budgeting<br>
<ul>
<li>it puts checks and balances in place in order to prevent overspending
at various levels;</li>
<li>it takes into account the unexpected need for funds;</li>
<li>it disciplines you in matters of earning and spending; and</li>
<li>it helps you to maintain same standard of living even after post
retirement</li>
</ul><br>
<b>d. InflationeffectsonInvestments</b>
While planning your investment, it is important to take into account the effects of inflation on your investments. Inflation is the rise in prices of goods and services. As the prices of goods and services increase, the value of rupee goes down and you will not be able to purchase as much with those rupees as you could have in the last month or last year.<br>
 
The effect of inflation on investment can be better understood with the following illustration:<br>
Say that your monthly consumption of petrol is 10 litres, costing you ` 500 @ ` 50 / litre. Further, you meet this expense out of the monthly interest income of ` 500, earned from your fixed deposit. If the inflation rate during the year is 10%, then price of petrol per litre would increase from ` 50 to ` 55 / litre. Accordingly, the next year you will not be able to purchase 10 litres of petrol, now costing ` 55 / litre, out your interest income of ` 500 from your fixed deposit. Hence your financial plan should aim to earn returns above the rate of inflation.<br>
e. RiskandReturn
Risk and return go hand in hand. Risk is loosely defined as the chance of loosing all or part of your money invested. The good news is that investment risk comes with the potential for return – which makes the activity worthwhile.
The basic thing to remember about risk is that it increases as the potential return increases. Essentially, higher the risk, the higher is the potential return. (Do not forget the two words - “potential return”. There is no guarantee).<br>
f. Power of Compounding
As you pursue your financial planning, the most powerful tool for creating wealth safely and surely is the magical ‘power of compounding’. If you park your money in an investment with a given return, and then reinvest those earnings as you receive them, your investment grows exponentially over time.
Illustratively, if you set aside a sum of say ` 5,000 every month from the age of 25, earning interest at the rate of 10% p.a., in 60 years you will have with you funds worth more than ` 1 crore. However, if you start at 40 with the same amount and rate of interest, the fund accumulated will amount to only around ` 33 lakh.<br>
Hence, it is always advisable to start savings early to enjoy the benefits of power of compounding<br>
g. TimeValueofMoney
Money has time value. As the time passes, the value of money decreases. This means that the value of a thousand rupee note you have today is higher than its value five years hence, even if there is no inflation. This is because we prefer consumption today to consumption in future which is uncertain. That is why, if you invest ` 1,000 today at 5% per annum, you<br>
would receive ` 1,050 after a year. Thus, ` 1,000 today is equivalent to ` 1,050 received after a year or its value one year hence.

            <b> Available:</b> There are a large variety of financial products available for investment. You need to choose the best product or the best combination of products to meet your preference and objectives. Your choice generally takes a balance view of three factors, namely, Liquidity, Safety and Return depending on the stage of life.<br>
<b>a. Savings Related products</b>
Bank deposits are generally safe because they are partly covered by deposit insurance and banks have high capital requirements. The banks are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India. They offer various types of deposits, depending on the needs of the customer. Bank deposits are preferred more for their liquidity and safety than for their returns.<br>
<b>b. Investment Related Products</b>
Company fixed deposits are fixed deposit scheme offered by (manufacturing) companies. They are similar to bank fixed deposits but entail lesser liquidity and usually carry higher risk and return.

• Housing Loan is just another loan with your house as the collateral.

paid to the legal heir.

of personal needs.
