            Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss. It is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent, uncertain loss.<br>

            An entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer, insurance company, or insurance carrier. A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an insured or policyholder. The insurance transaction involves the insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively small loss in the form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss. The loss may or may not be financial, but it must be reducible to financial terms, and must involve something in which the insured has an insurable interest established by ownership, possession, or preexisting relationship.<br>

            The insured receives a contract, called the insurance policy, which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insured will be financially compensated. The amount of money charged by the insurer to the insured for the coverage set forth in the insurance policy is called the premium. If the insured experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy, the insured submits a claim to the insurer for processing by a claims adjuster.<br>

            There are many arguments in favor of using permanent life insurance. The issue is: These benefits aren’t unique to permanent life insurance. You often can get them in other ways without paying the high management expenses and agent commissions that come with permanent life insurance. Let’s examine a few of the most widely advocated benefits of permanent life insurance one by one.<br></p>

            <ol>
                <li>You get tax-deferred growth: This benefit of the cash-value component of a permanent life insurance policy means you don’t pay taxes on any interest, dividends or capital gains in your life insurance policy until you withdraw the proceeds. You can get this same benefit, however, by putting your money in any number of retirement accounts, including traditional IRAs, 401(k)s, 403(b)s, SIMPLE IRAs, SEP IRAs and self-employed 401(k) plans.</li>
                <li>You can keep your policy until age 100, as long as you pay the premiums: A key advertised benefit of permanent life insurance over term life insurance is that you don’t lose your coverage after a set number of years. A term policy ends when you reach the end of your term, which for many policyholders is at age 65 or 70. But by the time you’re 100, who will need your death benefit? Most likely, the people you originally took out a life insurance policy to protect, your spouse and children, are either self-sufficient or have also passed away.</li>
                <li>You can borrow against the cash value to buy a house or send your kids to college, without paying taxes or penalties: ou can also use money you put in a savings account that you control – one on which you don’t pay fees and commissions – to buy a house or send your kids to college. But what insurance agents really mean when they make this point is that if you put money in a tax-advantaged retirement plan like a 401(k) and want to take it out for a purpose other than retirement, you might have to pay a 10% early distribution penalty plus the income tax that’s due. Further, some retirement plans, like 457(b)s, make it difficult or even impossible to take out money for one of these purposes.

                That being said, it’s generally a bad idea to jeopardize your retirement by raiding your retirement savings for some other purpose, penalties or not. It’s also a bad idea to confuse life insurance with a savings account. </li>
                <li>Permanent life insurance can provide accelerated benefits if you become critically or terminally ill: You may be able to receive anywhere from 25% to 100% of your permanent life insurance policy’s death benefit before you die if you develop a specified condition such as heart attack, stroke, invasive cancer or end-stage renal failure. The upside of accelerated benefits, as they’re called, is that you can use them to pay your medical bills and possibly enjoy a better quality of life in your final months. The drawback is that your beneficiaries won’t receive the full benefit you intended when you took out the policy. Also, your health insurance might already provide sufficient coverage for your medical bills.</li>

            <b>Arguments in Favor of Buying Term and Investing the Difference</b> <br>
            When you buy a term policy, all of your premiums go toward securing a death benefit for your beneficiaries, who are usually your spouse or children. Term life insurance, unlike permanent life insurance, does not have any cash value and therefore does not have any investment component. However, you can think of term life insurance as an investment in the sense that you are paying relatively little in premiums in exchange for a relatively large death benefit.<br>

            For example, a nonsmoking 30-year-old woman in excellent health might be able to get a 20-year term policy with a death benefit of $1 million for $480 per year. If this woman dies at age 49 after paying premiums for 19 years, her beneficiaries will receive $1 million tax-free when she paid in just $9,120. Term life insurance provides an incomparable return on investment should your beneficiaries ever have to use it. That being said, it provides a negative return on investment if you are in the majority of policyholders whose beneficiaries never file a claim. In that case, you will have paid a relatively low price for peace of mind, and you can celebrate the fact that you’re still alive.<br>

            Do you really hate the idea of potentially “throwing away” almost $10,000 over the next 20 years? What would happen if you invested $480 per year in the stock market instead? If you earned an average annual return of 8%, you’d have $25,960 after 20 years, before taxes and inflation. Considering the opportunity cost of putting that $480 per year into term life insurance premiums instead of investing it, you’re really “throwing away” $25,960. But if you die without life insurance during those 20 years, you’ll leave your heirs with almost nothing instead of leaving them with $1 million.<br>
